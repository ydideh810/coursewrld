As your school grows, your user base will also grow. Filters help you in sifting through your users to quickly find the users you are interested in.

## Work with multiple filters

You can add as many filters as you would like. You can additionally choose how these filters fit together.

CourseLit offers two ways to match filters.

##### Match any filter

Users matching any of the filters will show up in the results. This is the default.

##### Match all filters

Users matching all of the applied filters will show up in the results.

To switch the matching filter, select the desired option from the dropdown on the left (right beneath the `Segments` button).

## Search by email

CourseLit offers a quick way to search users via email addresses. If you know any part of the user's email, you can quickly search for it by typing in the search bar.

This filter behaves just like any other filter. Multiple patterns can be searched by entering one pattern at a time.
