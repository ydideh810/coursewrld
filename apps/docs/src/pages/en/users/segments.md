You can bucket users with common characteristics into distinct groups called `Segments`. User segmentation helps you in managing the users efficiently.

CourseLit offers an easy way to create new user segments. By default, your account has only one segment called `Everyone` which includes all the users in your school.

## Switching segments

By default, the `Everyone` segment is selected. The segment includes all the users in your school.

To switch to any other previously saved segment, click on the segment button i.e. the button with the `Everyone` label.

Let's see how to create a segment.

## Create a segment

To create a segment:

1. Apply some filters to reveal the `Save new segment` button.
