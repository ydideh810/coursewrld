CourseLit has a powerful user management using which you can manage not only your students but also your team members and newsletter subscribers.

## Viewing your users

Log in to your admin account and from the `Dashboard`, click on the `Users` menu item from the left side bar to get to users area.

## Filtering users

You can filter the users by the following two ways.

1. By email
2. By permissions

    CourseLit categorises users into four categories.

    - [**Customer**](/en/users/permissions#team-and-customer-users) - Everyone who has signed up for an account on your school
    - [**Team**](/en/users/permissions#team-and-customer-users) - Users who have atleast one of the admin permissions
    - **Subscriber** - Users who are subscribed to your newsletter
    - **Everyone** - All the users in your school

    This makes it easy for you to quickly search for people. The following screenshot shows the users filtered by team members permissions.
