Before you can start publishing your blogs, you need to set up a school. [Follow this guide](/en/schools/create) to get yourself a free account and create a school, if you haven't already.

Once you are signed in using an admin account, go to the dashboard by clicking on the `Dashboard` option from the drop down menu located on the top right corner of your school.

The dashboard looks like the following.
