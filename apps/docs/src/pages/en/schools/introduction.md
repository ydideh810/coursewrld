> This concept does not apply if you self-host CourseLit. In the self hosted instance, you get **only one school**.

A school is a logical container for all of your content. You can create as many schools as you would like under one subscription.

Let's understand this with an example.

Joe is a digital designer who likes to teach designing so he can setup a school called `joe-designs` in CourseLit. This school will be available at `joe-designs.courselit.app`.

Now, if Joe's also interested in teaching gardening, he can teach it under a separate school to keep things segregated so as to not confused his audience. For his gardening venture, he can create a new school called `jeo-gardening`.
