> This concept does not apply if you self-host CourseLit. In the self hosted instance, you get **only one school** which cannot be deleted.

If a school is no longer required, it can be deleted.

Keep in mind that this is a destructive action and you will not be able to recover (or restore) the data related to the school afterwards.

## Steps to delete a school

1. In the CourseLit dashboard, select the school you want to delete and click on the drop down button to expand its settings.
