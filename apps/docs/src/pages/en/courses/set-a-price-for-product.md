CourseLit makes it easy for you to earn a living by sharing your knowledge. CourseLit offers two types of pricing strategies.

1. Free
2. Paid

## Set up a free course

Free is the default pricing strategy. When you first create the course, the pricing is set to free.

You don't have to do anything.

## Set up a paid course

**In order to get paid for your offerings, you first need to [setup payments](). Currently, CourseLit offers [Stripe](https://stripe.com) integration.**

### Steps

1. From the `Products` section in the dashboard, select your product to open it in the editing mode.
2. Go to the `Pricing` tab.
