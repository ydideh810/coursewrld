If you do not want your product to show up on the `/courses` route, you can do that by using the visibility toggle. By default, your products are `Unlisted` i.e. they do not appear under courses list visible on `/courses` route.

Your audience will be able to access the course via a direct link only.

## Steps to make your product listed

1. From the `Products` section in the dashboard, select your product to open it in the editing mode.
2. Go to the `Publish` tab.

3. Click the `Unlisted` button to toggle the visibility of your product as shown above.
