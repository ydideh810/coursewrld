Before you can start building your course, you need to set up a school. [Follow this guide](/en/schools/create) to get yourself a free account and create a school, if you haven't already.

Once you are signed in using an admin account, go to the dashboard by clicking on the `Dashboard` option from the drop down menu located on the top right corner of your school.

The dashboard looks like the following.

> Both courses and digital downloads are categorized as products and will be shown under the `Products` screen.

7. Click on the `Publish` tab.

10. This is how your sales will look initially. It is barebones as of now. Visit our page builder guide to make it enticing.
