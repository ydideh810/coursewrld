Offering something for free in return of an email is a good way to build an email list which you can sell to later on.

This is generally known as **Lead Magnet**. Using digital downloads, you can easily create lead magnets.

There are two ways to create lead magnets using CourseLit which are as follows.

1. Hosting your downloads on CourseLit

For the you can [set the pricing as `free email delivery`](/en/downloads/set-a-price#set-up-free-email-delivery).

2. Hosting your downloads elsewhere i.e. on Google Drive, Dropbox etc.

[Use the `banner` block](/en/pages/banner#creating-a-lead-magnet) to embed a direct download link which becomes visible only after your users submit their emails.
